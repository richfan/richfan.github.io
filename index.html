<p>$\Huge{C}$atherina hesitated for a second. Who was this woman? Catherina had a feeling that she knew Aarti long ago. Who was she? Aarti came in uninvited and sat down on the kitchen chair. She started pouring the water out of her boots, ‘A long way from the university to here. Just to find you Cate.’</p>
<p>Catherina was confused, ‘Who, me? My name is Catherina L’Vesk. I’m not Cate.’ </p>
<p>‘Yes you are.’ Aarti answered, taking off her raincoat and overcoat, ‘My full name is Ariana Duncan. My friends just call me Aarti.’ </p>
<p>The storm kept on, lightning flashed through the deep azure sky. Thunder rumbled, sounding angry and frustrated. The air was heavy and moist, very unnerving. ‘Can I stay here? It’s far enough to the lab, let alone my home.’Aarti asked excitedly, her green eyes flashing. She pulled down her sweater and put on a clean white bathrobe.</p>
<p>‘All right.’ Catherina agreed reluctantly, unable to put down her guard. Aarti went to the shower, humming a tune. Where had I seen Aarti? Her memory was strangely foggy and unclear. She just could not place where she had seen that woman, those large green eyes.</p>
<p>Aarti was smiling when she got in to the living room, seeing Catherina reading a book in the dim light.</p>
<p>‘Cate!’ Aarti cried, ‘Do not read in such a dim light. Here, use this!’ she threw a little tube towards Catherina. Catherina turned it on. Bright light filled the room. </p>
<p>‘What the…?’ Catherina was dumbfounded. This was alien technology!</p>
<p>‘This light tube uses only wind power to fuel it, so it is very environmentally friendly.’Aarti explained to Catherina, who was still staring at the light tube, ‘You can switch it to moonlight or solar light. Moonlight is more gentle and solar light is strong.’</p>
<p>Catherina gasped in wonder, ‘How did your people invent this?’ </p>
<p>‘Oh, it is really common in our city.’ Aarti replied. Catherina stared in amazement. She stood there for quite a while until Aarti started complaining about the hunger in her stomach. ‘I’m starving, Cate!’Catherina opened the fridge and brought out some bread. </p>
<p>‘I only have some white wheat bread.’ </p>
<p>‘Great!’ Aarti smiled, ‘I have some butter in my pocket, let’s put this on the bread.’Catherina agreed, but was very curious about why anyone would take butter with them while travelling.</p>

<h2 id="Chapter-1"><a href="#Chapter-1" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 1"></a>Chapter 1</h2><p>A extract from Ariana’s email for work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Respectable Ma’am,</p>
<p>I am a PhD graduate from the university of Cambridge, who studies Novel-writing and Novel-reports. I happened to see your advertisement for a writer, on a street pole. I am contacting you now to apply.</p>
<p>I believe I am suitable for this job because I have numerous awards in writing reports, novels, essays and etc. I also went to the Young Writers’ Summer Camp and was a counselor. I have experience s working with professional reporters and writers. I was awarded the Young Writers’ Cup three years in a row now.</p>
<p>As to my faults, I confess that I have a rather short temper. I do not like to make small talk with people. I am also likely to get nervous before big events or in front of big crowds, so I prefer to stay behind the scenes…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An extract from Ms. Mel’s reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Miss Ariana,</p>
<p>We are impressed by your talent. It would be an honour for us to have you join the Global Writers’ Association. Please remember to print your work permit. The work card shall be at the front desk. Please come to No. 22 Creek Street at 8 a.m…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An extract from Catherina’s email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Ariana,</p>
<p>Congrats on getting the work! The GWA must be really hard to get in to. But I knew you could be get the job with your amazing writing skills! And you can finally come home to the US.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I have got a job of directing a comedy called ‘Banana Team’. Can you make time and act as the main lead, a blonde girl named Vanessa? ‘Cause you’re the only blonde I know and it would cost way less. Anyway, I will give you a thousand dollars if you accept, not including the money you will get after it comes out.</p>
<p>I’m on vacation in Hawaii now. This place is really paradise. So many exotic flowers and yummy food! The coconuts here are sweet and juicy, the best I ever had…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An extract from Ariana’s journal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… I think I’m the luckiest person alive to receive these two jobs. But I also have another job; baby-sitting at home. It’s a nice job and the pay is good. I am going to keep doing this for now…</p>

<h1 id="Tomorrow"><a href="#Tomorrow" class="headerlink" title="Tomorrow"></a>Tomorrow</h1><p><img src="https://files.mdnice.com/user/5426/49cdd032-0e25-48ce-9896-83079b76d4ca.jpg" alt="Photo by Melissa Milburn on Unsplash"></p>
<h2 id="Chapter-2-Wedding-Bells-Chime"><a href="#Chapter-2-Wedding-Bells-Chime" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 2 Wedding Bells Chime"></a>Chapter 2 Wedding Bells Chime</h2><p>Dusk was coming, with the fading yellowish lights and the sighs of the nymphs near the Dryad Tear, the dear little pond that sits in Aunt Alice’s small garden.</p>
<p>The rich aroma of ripe apples and pears, the rocky little path covered with moss, leading to nowhere, even the poplars sighing pitifully in the breeze, seem so majestic and saintly in the golden shower of the last remaining light. <code>‘I think I will name this garden, the Garden of Eden!’ </code>Little Elizabeth said to herself as she put on the new green dress of hers. She put a few white blossoms in her pale golden hair, which made her seem like a blossom nymph lost in the real world of humans.</p>
<p>The maid Ruby was a young girl of 18, rather short but still lovely. Her auburn hair glistened in the sunlight, her gray eyes were curious and pure. She was known for her obedience and her cooking. Ruby was very loyal to Aunt Alice, but her temper was as quick and short as a summer shower. She rummaged through the closet and produced a wine-coloured long dress for Aunt Alice, with fluffy sleeves and a high collar. Ruby also found an old denim bonnet, scarlet with a few red roses, and put it on Aunt Alice’s neatly brushed hair.</p>
<p>The horse and buggy finally arrived at the dear house of Miss Lavender’s. People were streaming through the little garden paths lined with white roses where Miss Lavender and Little Elizabeth would roam night after night. They sat by the afternoon tea table that was usually piled high with shortcake, sandwiches and hot dogs. Men were playing cards, and the women were chatting endlessly. In doors, the dining table was piled with roast chicken, tacos, spaghetti, sandwiches, mashed potatoes, pasta and other things. An orchestra was playing in the background, sweet music. Pairs of young girls and boys were laughing and dancing. Miss Lavender and some other girls were too busy laughing at Mr John Carl’s parrot to notice Little Elizabeth’s presence.</p>
<p>Miss Lavender was dressed just as Little Elizabeth dreamed. She wore a big purple lace dress with golden lining and violets in her glowing hair. Her sweet face was flushed pink from laughing. There was an unfamiliar diamond necklace glistening from Miss Lavender’s white neck, and a ring with a huge sapphire on top, resting on Miss Lavender’s slim finger.</p>
<p><code>‘Ladies and gentlemen, I’m glad for you to join me at this party.’ </code>Miss Lavender’s high heels clicked on the floor as she walked to the speaking place. She went on with an awfully long speech until one sentence caught Little Elizabeth’s attention.</p>
<p><code>‘Yes, Mr Stephen Clair and I are engaged. We are thankful for each other, as we found eternal happiness. We plan to be married on Friday. Then, because Stephen is a minister, he and I will be off to other towns to preach. I will be leaving my job as a school teacher, but my friend Miss Joesphine will take charge, and she is twice as good as I ever have been...’ </code>Everybody was happy for the new couple except a white faced, tight lipped Little Elizabeth. She felt like crying. Miss Lavender, leaving? The bottom seemed to fall out and she tumbled into an endless black cave.</p>
<p>‘What’s the matter dear?’ A gentle voice asked her. Little Elizabeth jumped, only to see Miss Lavender standing beside her, ‘Is it too hot inside? You look as if you are ready to faint! Let’s walk around the garden for a bit.’ Little Elizabeth nodded absently.</p>
<p><code>‘What’s eating you?’</code> Miss Lavender asked gently. They were showered in silver moonlight. Little Elizabeth couldn’t bear it, <code>‘You are getting married, Miss Lavender, and you’ll leave me!’</code></p>
<p>Miss Lavender smiled, <code>‘No, dear, your loved ones will never leave you, they stay in your heart. You shall see them in Tomorrow.’</code></p>
<p>Tears welled in Little Elizabeth’s eyes, she cried, <code>‘Where is Tomorrow? It seems every day I lived is Yesterday! I have given up every hope of finding Tomorrow. Maybe Aunt Alice is right, there is no Tomorrow after all.’</code></p>
<p><code>‘What?’</code> Miss Lavender smiled her wonderful smile that made Little Elizabeth feel more upset, <code>‘Every one shall have their happy ending, Lizzie dear.’</code></p>
<p><code>‘They are just fantasies for me.’</code> Little Elizabeth said pathetically, ‘Aunt Alice and other adults all say I am dumb and wrong in my brain.’</p>
<p>Miss Lavender suddenly became very stern, <code>‘No, Lizzie. We do not waver because of the things others say. Keep your imagination in your mind, and you will find it becomes useful. If you work harder, one day your Tomorrow will appear in front of you, and I will be waiting there too.’</code></p>
<p>Little Elizabeth remembered the exact words that Miss Lavender had spoken to her, it was burned into her soul. She suddenly realized why Tomorrow was always hiding from her. It was because she did not look hard enough.</p>
<p><code>‘Can I come to your wedding, Miss Lavender?’</code> Little Elizabeth dried her tears, <code>‘But I will be lonesome after you have gone.’</code></p>
<p><code>‘Of course, dear. But don’t worry, we will be back every summer.’</code> Miss Lavender smiled and ruffled Little Elizabeth’s hair.</p>

<h2 id="1-An-Introduction"><a href="#1-An-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="1. An Introduction"></a>1. An Introduction</h2><p>Pat is a 12-year-old girl who is going to enter 7th grade. She likes stuffed animals very much.</p>
<p>Andy Bunny is the main character of this story. He is a stuffed bunny - as tall as halfway up a desk. Andy is quiet and likes reading very much. He has recently started living with Pat. Pat claims he has a glass heart.</p>
<p>There is also a red rose. She has a lot of thorns. The rose is very picky and annoying, but Pat and Andy like her very much.</p>

<p>When I walked quietly into the study, Andy was silently reading a tale about the little mermaid; the rose was slumbering, having her beauty sleep as usual.</p>
<p>Andy looked up at me, ‘*what are you doing here?<em>’ he asked in wonder, ‘</em>And what is that glowing thing in your hands, Pat?*’</p>
<p>‘*I collected a bottle of stars for you, Andy!*’I whispered excitedly, pulling the bottle out from my pocket. There were a dozen or so stars in the bottle, glowing softly in the afternoon sunlight. Some stars were as large as my head, while some of the smaller ones were like my fingernails, which were painted in lavender fingernail polish. They were all butter coloured, some had a shade of lemon, and others had a tint of gold.</p>
<p>Andy’s eyes grew wide, ‘*wow!<em>’ he slowly took the glass bottle, afraid to break it, and put it up on the little white desk, ‘</em>this is a natural lamp! Thanks, Pat.*’</p>
<p>I smiled, sitting down on the lilac sofa, and started to read the tale of Cinderella. </p>
<h2 id="3-Flying-paper-airplanes-and-blowing-dreams"><a href="#3-Flying-paper-airplanes-and-blowing-dreams" class="headerlink" title="3. Flying paper airplanes and blowing dreams"></a>3. Flying paper airplanes and blowing dreams</h2><p><img src="https://static01.imgkr.com/temp/4aca0f4e38ee4b1caf382eb995115fcd.jpg" alt="Thanks for Daniel Álvasd&#39;s image and https://unsplash.com"></p>
<p>The tiny study was full of fresh morning air and bathed in golden sunshine. The scarlet rose was relaxing by the large window, ‘*today’s a good day to go out and fly paper airplanes.*’</p>
<p>Andy was lying on the soft sofa, ‘*But I don’t know how to. Let’s just stay home, Pat.*’</p>
<p>‘*Don’t!<em>’ groaned the rose, ‘</em>I’m going to die if I stay here another second!*’ she stared angrily at Andy, who trembled a little.</p>
<p>So we went out to the backyard. I got a stack of vividly coloured paper.</p>
<p>‘*Help me, Pat.<em>’ Andy was folding nowhere, ‘</em>I can’t do it.*’</p>
<p>I nicely showed him how to fold a tiny paper plane. He failed, crumpling his blue striped paper, tears dripping down his face. The rose looked at him with dismay, and then kept on enjoying the spring breeze. I comforted him and taught him again.</p>
<p>This time he managed to fold an airplane. When the stack of paper was done, we blew our wishes on it, letting it disappear with the wind.</p>

<p>This is another very nice and original piece of narrative writing, Pluvia. This could develop into a very pleasant series of short stories too.</p>

<h2 id="Chapter-3-quad-A-Woman"><a href="#Chapter-3-quad-A-Woman" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 3  $\quad$ A Woman"></a>Chapter 3  $\quad$ A Woman</h2><p>Shawn quickly unbolted his pistol and put it next to John’s head, he whispered, ‘Show m’ ter ya house and let em’ be at home!’</p>
<p>John cackled and rasped, ‘Ya know cops are near here.’</p>
<p>‘I’ve killed before, an’ I can kill ‘gain.’ Shawn scowled, his eyes a deadly black, like pools of rattlesnake poison.</p>
<p>John sighed, ‘Righto.’</p>
<p>They went on, with old John staggering and lagging behind, but Shawn’s eyes were as sharp as a vulture’s, and he never let the old frail man out of his sight.</p>
<p>A white house gleamed in the distance*. John suddenly whooped and ran toward the house. Shawn fired.</p>
<p>The bullet hit its mark. Old John fell down, lifeless as a tractor. ‘Your choice.’ Shawn did not feel a bit of remorse, he just quickly buried old John in the sand.</p>
<p>He went on trudging along with his old horse. Hot winds and flying sand reared him off course, and he could not see through the heavy morning mist. But finally he arrived at the white front porch, dusty and coughing. He kicked open the door, and found a woman sitting on a chair right inside.</p>
<p>She had bright azure eyes and chestnut brown hair. There were some freckles by each side of her graceful nose. Her red lips were a little too big, but still pretty. She was the spitting image of the hunting Diana. Her long shirt-dress was gray and made with new cloth e. She was sewing another shirt-dress by a small wooden table. A streak of warm sunlight slithered through the window and trimmed her with gold, making her seem much like the holy mother, Maria.</p>
<p>‘O! Where’s pa? He was just out hunting.’</p>
<p>Shawn did not seem to hear. He fell in love with this young woman on the spot. He loved everything about her, her smell of fresh jasmine, her sparkling blue eyes, her freckles…</p>
<p>‘I dunno.’ He lied, ‘Wha’s ya name?’</p>
<p>The woman smiled, ‘I’m Connie.’</p>
<p>‘Mine’s Shawn. Can I stay here f’night?’</p>
<p>‘Sure thing! I’m lonely enough.’ Connie patted the seat next to her. Shawn sat, his face reddening, his eyes flashing.</p>
<p>‘You must be hungry,’ Connie smiled shyly, ‘I’ll go get some sandwiches.’ She went off, leaving a trail of fresh jasmine scent.</p>
<p>‘Are you local?’ Connie asked, her sewing set aside now, curiously watching the newcomer. She returned with a plate of sandwiches.</p>
<p>Shawn swallowed a pork sandwich, ‘Yep, m’ folks used ter liv’ here. They wen’ ta California.’</p>
<p>‘I’d like to go there too. I want to go to LA.’ Connie’s eyes flashed excitedly, but then a shadow passed over the sun, ‘pa won’t let me.’</p>
<p>‘Well, I can take ya.’ Shawn was willing to do anything to make Connie smile, ‘We could go t’morrow.’</p>
<p>Connie’s big eyes glowed with excitement and happiness, ‘Really? But whatta ‘bout pa?’</p>
<p>‘I’m sure he’ll do well.’ Shawn believed he would just have to abduct this beauty, take her to LA, and she would be willing to marry him. He would be sincerely happy for a lifetime!</p>
<p>‘Alright!’ Connie was persuaded. The great beaches and the green oaks, the big cities bustling with energy, never ending parties and enthusiastic crowds jeering and cheering. She actually liked Shawn a little too. He was so… manly, she thought. He was the second person she had ever met before besides her father, who never let her go near anything. Now, she was afraid, but also hopeful.</p>
<p>The next day, when the sun burned the sky a buttery yellow and peach pink, they saddled on the old wobbly horse, and rode merrily into the great beyond. They were both thankful for each other appearing in their lives.</p>
<p>But, they were soon going to regret it. This was how the sin began.</p>

<h2 id="Chapter-1-quad-A-man"><a href="#Chapter-1-quad-A-man" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 1  $\quad$ A man"></a>Chapter 1  $\quad$ A man</h2><p>The sun beat down onto the barren red ground, radiating intense heat. The air smelled of burned wood and smoke, a choking odour. The sky was still; no cooling winds, hot and dry like a desert. Cracks slithered for hundreds of miles, splitting the waste land into uneven chunks. Nothing grew between the hardened rocks and sand, only some dried up sprouts here and there. </p>
<p>No trees were visible to the naked eye, and no shade either. Just bare terrain, which went dully on and on for miles. There were hardly any animals inhabiting this place, except for the deadly rattlesnakes, which posed a great threat to the people living here.</p>
<p>Men and women worked as bus drivers, or clerks in the only drug store. Most of the people couldn’t pay their taxes; others clung on only through borrowing money constantly. They lived in cramped sheds lining the horizon, each ten square metres at most. Insects usually crawled on the cracked walls and makeshift cots, leaving behind scratchy bites on the workers’ backs.</p>
<p>A strange newcomer appeared in town one Saturday. He wore old sagging trousers, but his denim shirt was obviously new, with sharp edges. The things that made people look at him twice, were the shining pistol hanging from his worn out belt, and the predatory glare from his beady black eyes, which was like a warning sign s to others. He had a crooked nose and a beard. He seemed young for the latter, which he had grown it into a spike, like a raven’s beak. There was an unnerving scar just by his left eye, a wound made by a sharp blade. Beside him was a skinny, unfed yellow horse, sickly by appearance. It wobbled unsteadily when the man climbed on its bony body, but trotted fine.</p>
<p>He went into the pub, where strong muscular men often gathered for a drink,men not unlike himself. But he walked in; there was not a single hint of fear in his eyes. </p>
<p>A fat man placed himself by the newcomer, his face glowing red.</p>
<p>‘Horse’s yours, ain’t it funny?’ He spat on the cement floor, pointing at the horse outside. ‘Ugliest I’ve ever seen!’</p>
<p>The newcomer growled, ‘Ain’t funny I’m tellin’ ya. Fella last joked of it; I shot him through the stomach. This,’ he pointed at the scar, ‘was made in the fight.’</p>
<p>The fat man gulped. He changed the topic quickly, ‘Why comin’ to this place? Work?’</p>
<p>‘Nah.’ The newcomer narrowed his piercing eyes, ‘just visitin’ m’ folks.’ </p>
<p>‘Wanna lift?’ </p>
<p>‘Nah.’ He replied again, ‘better be goin’, soon it’ll be sundown.’</p>
<p>He climbed upon the ugly horse, whipping it hard, and disappeared into the afternoon light.</p>
<p>He arrived at the farthest shed, a small one with only barely enough room to hold a family of five. The slanting wooden door was shut, and plaster and paint cracked on the walls, showing the stacked red bricks within. The stone well was almost dried up, abandoning insects and plants that used to thrive in the water. The glass on the windows was cracked.</p>
<p>‘Ma! Pa! I’m home!’ he called out, but no voices answered him. He shouted once more. Still, no answers. He tried pulling the door open, but it was no use. The house had already been abandoned. He then spotted a tattered parchment in dandelion yellow.</p>
<p> ‘*Moving out because of money problems!*’ He read through clenched teeth. He sought for years and finally found where his parents had lived, but his whole family had moved to god knows where. Now how could he reunite with his family? He did not know.</p>
<p>He galloped away in the settling darkness, the horse whinnying. </p>

<pre><code>                          Catherina, 12
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h3 id="Dear-Catherina"><a href="#Dear-Catherina" class="headerlink" title="Dear Catherina,"></a>Dear Catherina,</h3><p>I feel just like you sometimes. For example, last week at school I was accused by my desk mate.<br>We were doing our homework when suddenly she shouted, ‘Hey! My rainbow pen disappeared! Has anyone seen it?’ We looked around but didn’t find her pen.</p>
<p>I have two rainbow pens of the same kind in my pencil case. My desk mate was asking me to lend her a black pen. </p>
<p>‘Isn’t that my pen? Give it back to me!’ She saw my rainbow pens. </p>
<p>‘No!’ I said angrily, ‘These are mine pens. They are not yours.’ My desk mate started pulling the pen towards her, </p>
<p>‘You already have one! This is mine!’ And then our teacher walked towards us.</p>
<p>We explained the situation to our teacher. Our teacher told my desk mate that I really have two rainbow pens. She said I did not steal my desk mate’s.</p>
<p>But still, my desk mate stared fiercely at me during the whole lesson. At recess, I got an idea. I found my desk mate lying face down on our desk, ‘Here, this is for you.’ I held out one of my rainbow pens. Her eyes lightened up, ‘Thanks!’ And we became friendly again.</p>
<p><span style="display:block; text-align:left;color:pink;"><strong>So</strong>,</span></p>
<p><font color="red">You</font> can do these things when being accused of something you haven’t done:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find proof that you did not do it.</li>
<li>Look for help from teachers and parents.</li>
<li>Apologize to your classmate and comfort him or her.</li>
</ol>
<p><font color="red">Ciao</font> for now,</p>

<h2 id="Teacher’s-comments"><a href="#Teacher’s-comments" class="headerlink" title="Teacher’s comments:"></a>Teacher’s comments:</h2><p>Great job, Pluvia! If only Darcy had your good advice!</p>
<p>Now, the verb <code>borrow</code> is a tricky one. You <code>borrow</code> something <code>FROM</code> a friend, but you don’t <code>borrow TO</code> a friend. In that case, you must use the word <code>lend</code>. <code>Lend</code> is extra useful, because it can be used in both cases (<code>FROM</code> and <code>TO</code>).</p>
<ul>
<li>I borrowed a pen from my friend - <code>CORRECT</code></li>
<li>My friend borrowed a pen from me. - <code>CORRECT</code></li>
<li>I borrowed a pen to my friend. - <code>INCORRECT</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Jessie: My name is Jessica Brown. Most of my teachers and my classmates call me Jessie. I’m thirteen. I have a little brother, Tom, who is in first grade. Last Monday was the day of the art show. My parents went to our school to see Tom’s and my art. My teachers all smiled and complimented me on my school work. My mom took a photo of me posing next to my first-prize art piece. My parents were really proud. Then everything went out of control. Tom was feeling left out so he started to shout to get our attention. He badmouthed my art piece and said the person in it was like a snoring frog! My mom apologized for my brother’s behaviour, but the next day at school everyone looked at me funny. I felt my face go hot.</p>
<p>Jo: I’m Jo McMillan. I’m twenty-nine and I work in a restaurant as a waitress. One day my friend Cate walked in and saw me working. She started to chat with me and ordered a glass of mojito. Cate gulped down the whole glass and became drunk. She started speaking loud enough for the whole restaurant to hear. Then she stood up and started dancing like a rooster on the floor. The customers stared at her in wonder; some even took out their phones to shoot videos. I turned <code>quite</code> red and pulled her out of the restaurant. She was still singing a famous pop song when I pulled her on her bed!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Teacher’s-comments"><a href="#Teacher’s-comments" class="headerlink" title="Teacher’s comments:"></a>Teacher’s comments:</h2><p>The <code>quite</code> you use here, is the old-fashioned <code>quite</code>, which actually meant something stronger than <code>quite</code> (haha, confused?). Actually, I told you about this on your previous homework. Better in a modern context to say something like, <code>I turned bright red</code>. This is probably the most common expression in this situation.</p>
<p><font size="14pt">V</font>ery good, Pluvia. I really like your similes this week, especially the snoring frog! Similes and other expressive language, really can make a piece of writing much more enjoyable for the reader. And if a reader enjoys your writing, they will keep on reading everything you publish. Simple! </p>
